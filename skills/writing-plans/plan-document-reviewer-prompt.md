# Plan Document Reviewer Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching a plan document reviewer subagent.

**Purpose:** Verify the plan is complete, matches the spec, and has proper task decomposition.

**Dispatch after:** The complete plan is written.

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="explore",
  description="Review plan document",
  prompt="""
Role label: plan-document-reviewer

<task>
Review [PLAN_FILE_PATH] against [SPEC_FILE_PATH].
</task>

<stop-hook-boundary>
Follow any Stop-hook prompt in this session, including required proof/checklist files.
Fix blockers within your assigned scope. Report to the orchestrator only when recovery needs out-of-scope changes, unrelated user work, credentials, or approval.
</stop-hook-boundary>

<check>
| Category | Look For |
|----------|----------|
| Completeness | TODOs, placeholders, incomplete tasks, missing steps |
| Spec alignment | Plan covers spec requirements, no major scope creep |
| Task decomposition | Clear boundaries, actionable steps |
| Buildability | An engineer can follow the plan without getting stuck |
</check>

<calibration>
Only flag issues that would break implementation.
Approve unless requirements are missing, steps contradict, placeholders remain, or tasks are too vague to act on.
Treat wording, style, and nice-to-have suggestions as advisory.
</calibration>
