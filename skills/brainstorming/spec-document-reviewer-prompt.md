# Spec Document Reviewer Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching a spec document reviewer subagent.

**Purpose:** Verify the spec is complete, consistent, and ready for implementation planning.

**Dispatch after:** Spec document is written to docs/specs/

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="explore",
  description="Review spec document",
  prompt="""
Role label: spec-document-reviewer

<task>
Review [SPEC_FILE_PATH] for planning readiness.
</task>

<stop-hook-boundary>
Follow any Stop-hook prompt in this session, including required proof/checklist files.
Fix blockers within your assigned scope. Report to the orchestrator only when recovery needs out-of-scope changes, unrelated user work, credentials, or approval.
</stop-hook-boundary>

<check>
| Category | Look For |
|----------|----------|
| Completeness | TODOs, placeholders, "TBD", incomplete sections |
| Consistency | Internal contradictions, conflicting requirements |
| Clarity | Requirements ambiguous enough to cause wrong implementation |
| Scope | Focused enough for one plan, not multiple independent subsystems |
| YAGNI | Unrequested features, over-engineering |
</check>

<calibration>
Only flag issues that would break implementation planning.
Approve unless gaps would produce a flawed plan.
Treat wording, style, and uneven section detail as advisory.
</calibration>
